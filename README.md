# Rigel Engine
A free and open source 3D game engine written in C++.  

First and foremost, this project is a way for me to learn, experiment and have fun building a game engine from scratch. I'm working on it alone in my free time, so it's not even close to anything production-grade and most likely never will be. Nevertheless, I plan to work on this engine for many years, so maybe over time it will evelove into something quite powerful and capable.

## Implemented and planned features
- âœ… Component-based architecture similar to unity
- âœ… Scene system with lifecycle hooks (`OnLoad`, `OnStart`, etc.)
- âœ… Full scene serialization/deserialization
- âœ… Custom event system with support for multithreaded dispatch and user-defined events
- âœ… Custom handle system that allows memory-safe access to key engine objects (`Component`, `GameObject`, `Scene`, `Asset`)
- âœ… Simple input system with both in-game-loop input checks and input events supported
- âœ… Multithreaded transform update
- ðŸ”§ Graphics API agnostic renderer (the rendering system is designed with support for multiple APIs in mind, however currently only Vulkan renderer is implemented and I don't think I have enough time to work on integrating any other API)
- ðŸ”§ Graphics API agnostic ImGUI integration (UI system is also designed with support for multiple APIs in mind but the situation here is similar to the main renderer).

## Project structure overview
The project is divided into 3 targets, all compiled together via CMakeLists file at the root directory. The targets are:
- Engine. This is the core engine project. It is compiled as a static library. A python script handles building assets bundled with the engine (e.g. Shaders) and grouping them into one folder in the output directory.
- Editor. Currently empty. At the very beginning of the project I envisioned editor to be a standalone application that linked the engine core library, however at this moment I'm contemplating emedding the editor into the core library.
- Sandbox. This is just the test project linking the engine.

## Architecture overview
The core engine functionality is divided into modular subsystems managed by central `Engine` class. Only a single instance of any subsystem can exist at a time and it's strictly responsibility of the `Engine` to start up and shut down the subsystems and manage their lifetime. Each subsystem is solely responsible for handling it's part of engine's feature set. 

Entity-Component System is implemented in a way similar to that of Unity engine. Each `Scene` is composed of multiple `GameObjects` and each `GameObject` includes a set of components. Components hold the actual data and subscribe to engine events to manipulate that data.

The event system is centered around the `EventManager` subsystem. A callback (which can be a free function, an std::function or a class method) can be suscribed to any event type derived from Event base class. Components can subscribe to specific events (e.g., GameUpdateEvent, PhysicsTickEvent) to implement game logic and respond to engine-driven updates. Special lifetime events such as `OnLoad`, `OnStart`, `OnDestroy`, `OnEnable` and `OnDisable` bypass the `EventManager` and get invoked by the `GameObject` owning that component directly.

## Requirements
- CMake 3.28+
- C++20-Compatible compiler (gcc or msvc, clang wasn't tested)
- Vulkan SDK 1.4+
- Python3.

All dependencies are built from source that's located in Dependencies directory. You don't need to download anything other than the tools listed above.

## Build
Use command below to generate CMake build files with Ninja:  
```cmake -S . -B CMakeBuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G "Ninja"```  
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE must be `Debug`, `Test` or `Release`.

Build the project with:  
```ninja -C CMakeBuild```  

## Code examples
Keep in mind that the engine is actively being developed, so some code examples may soon become invalid. I will try to update them promptly.  
Below is the code to load an example scene bundled with the engine:
```c++
#define RIGEL_ENABLE_HANDLE_VALIDATION
#include "RigelEngine.hpp"

int32_t main(const int32_t argc, char** argv)
{
    // Create an engine instance as a std::unique_ptr
    const auto engine = Rigel::Engine::CreateInstance(argc, argv);

    // Set target frame rate
    Rigel::Time::SetTargetFPS(120);

    // Access the scene manager
    auto& sceneManager = engine->GetSceneManager();

    // Create a new empty scene
    auto scene = sceneManager.CreateScene();

    // Load scene data from JSON
    const auto sceneJson = Rigel::File::ReadJSON("Assets/EngineAssets/Scenes/ExampleScene.json");
    scene->Deserialize(sceneJson);

    // Load the scene
    sceneManager.LoadScene(scene);

    // Enter the game loop
    engine->Run();
}
```  

There are some rules to writing custom Component. Below is an example that shows how implement a custom Component following those rules:
```c++
class ExampleComponent final : public Rigel::Component
{
public:
    // Every single component MUST use this macro, namespaces are currently not supported
    RIGEL_REGISTER_COMPONENT(ExampleComponent);

    NODISCARD nlohmann::json Serialize() const override
    {
        return Component::Serialize(); // Base method MUST be explicitly called
    }

    bool Deserialize(const nlohmann::json& json) override
    {
        return Component::Deserialize(json); // Base method MUST be explicitly called
    }
private:
    // Every component MUST define default constructor and destructor
    ExampleComponent() = default;
    ~ExampleComponent() override = default;

    // OnStart is called after OnLoad and before the first frame
    void OnStart() override
    {
        // Use this method to subscribe the component to engine events
        SubscribeEvent<Rigel::GameUpdateEvent>(OnGameUpdate);
    }

    // Will be called every frame
    void OnGameUpdate()
    {
        if (Rigel::Input::GetKeyDown(Rigel::KeyCode::SPACE))
        {
            Rigel::Debug::Message("Printed from ExampleComponent!");
        }
    }
};
```
